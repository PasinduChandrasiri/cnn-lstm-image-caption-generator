# cnn-lstm-image-caption-generator
I built this repo to show how to generate image captions using a custom CNN-LSTM model, trained from scratchâ€”no pre-trained networks. It covers data prep, model design, training, and evaluation. If you want to see deep learning for image captioning in action, check this out!
